# Security validation scripts for testing environment controls.

<h1 align="center">⚠️ Disclosure ⚠️</h1>

These scripts have been borrowed from various web sources (i.e., Red Canary, Black Hills, DFIR, etc.) and have been manipulated in some way/shape/form to work for my needs. Often times this includes custom code or referances pertinent to needs at the time of writing. In most cases I've also feed code through an AI to summarize (generate the descriptions at the head of code) to sake of being concise and consistent. In some cases I've also leveraged AI to assist in writing additional code.

Anything in here should be treated as malicious/hostile and only executed if you have permission to do so _AND_ understand what the code is doing.
