Security validation scripts for testing environment controls.

Full disclosure: These scripts have been borrowed from various web sources (i.e., Red Canary, Black Hills, DFIR, etc.) and have been manipulated in some way/shape/form to work for my needs. Often times, this includes custom code or referances pertinent to my needs at the time of writing. In most cases I've also feed code through an AI to summarize (generate the descriptions at the head of code) to sake of being concise and consistent.

Anything in here should be treated as potentially malicious/hostile and only executed if you both have permission to do so **AND** understand what the code is doing.

You have been warned.
